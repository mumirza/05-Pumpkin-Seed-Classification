**Project Scope**

I worked with the Pumpkin Seed dataset, which encompasses a comprehensive list of variables reflecting various attributes of pumpkin seeds. The dataset categorizes these seeds into two distinct classes: 'Çerçevelik' and 'Ürgüp Sivrisi.' These classes represent different varieties of pumpkin seeds, each with unique characteristics that are pivotal in agricultural practices and seed classification. Understanding these differences is crucial for stakeholders in the agriculture sector, as it helps in optimizing seed selection for planting and processing.

In this project, I delve into the dataset by conducting an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This involves computing summary statistics for each variable to identify any correlations and imbalances within the dataset. Following the EDA, I employ the Support Vector Machines (SVM) technique to mine the data. This advanced analytical approach enables the classification and prediction of seed categories based on the measured attributes. The goal is to provide a model that not only accurately classifies pumpkin seeds but also offers insights into the factors that most significantly influence seed classification. This analysis and the resultant model could be pivotal in enhancing decision-making processes related to agricultural planning and seed quality assessment.

**Exploratory Data Analysis**

Both 'area' and 'convex area' show large ranges with values spanning from around 47,939 to 1,365,740 and 48,366 to 1,383,840 respectively. The median and mean are closely aligned, indicating a relatively symmetric distribution despite the broad spread, as shown by the high standard deviations and IQRs.

Perimeter, Major Axis Length, and Minor Axis Length variables also exhibit large variances in their values but maintain a near-symmetry between the mean and median. The minor axis length has the least variability among them, suggesting more consistency in this particular dimension of the seeds.

Equiv Diameter and Eccentricity both show smaller ranges and lower variability compared to size measurements, with means and medians nearly identical, indicating symmetric distributions. Eccentricity's low standard deviation and IQR point to tight clustering around the mean.

Solidity, Extent, and Roundness characteristics display tight distributions with very low standard deviations and IQRs, and the median approximating the mean closely, indicating consistent measurements across the samples.

Aspect Ratio and Compactness variables show slight deviation between mean and median, suggesting minor skewness in their distributions. Their moderate IQRs relative to their means suggest a modest spread around the central value.

Overall, the similarity of the mean and median in most variables suggests that the data does not have significant skewness. The wide ranges in variables related to size (area, perimeter, axis lengths) reflect considerable variability in physical dimensions among the pumpkin seeds.

The classes, 'Çerçevelik' and 'Ürgüp Sivrisi', are represented by horizontal bars, demonstrating their respective counts within the dataset.

Both classes appear to be nearly equally represented, with 'Çerçevelik' showing a slightly higher count compared to 'Ürgüp Sivrisi'. This near-equal representation is advantageous for predictive modeling as it reduces the likelihood of class imbalance that could potentially bias the model's performance. A balanced dataset ensures that the predictive model developed from this data is less likely to overfit to the more frequent class and can generalize better to new, unseen data. 

This balanced distribution is crucial for maintaining the integrity and accuracy of classification models, making the insights derived from such analyses more reliable and robust.

Variables such as 'perimeter', 'area', 'equiv_diameter', and 'convex_area' show very high correlations with each other (values close to 1), suggesting that these measurements, which are all related to the size and shape of the seeds, are interdependent.

The 'roundness' shows a strong negative correlation with 'major_axis_length' (around -0.89), indicating that as seeds become longer in their major axis, they tend to be less round. 

'Eccentricity' is strongly positively correlated with 'aspect_ratio' and 'major_axis_length', and shows varying degrees of negative correlation with 'solidity' and 'roundness', which aligns with the expected geometric properties of seeds where more elongated seeds tend to be less solid and round.

These correlations are critical for understanding the relationships between different seed characteristics and can guide further analyses, such as feature selection for predictive modeling, ensuring that redundant features are identified and managed appropriately.

**Key Insights**

**Support Vector Machine**

The model utilizes C-classification, a common choice for binary classification tasks. This method focuses on finding a hyperplane that separates the data with the maximum margin while penalizing misclassifications. 

The kernel used is radial (also known as Radial Basis Function or RBF), which is effective for handling cases where the relationship between class labels and attributes is non-linear. The radial kernel can map the inputs into a higher-dimensional space, making it easier to find a linear separation.

The cost parameter is set to 1, balancing the trade-off between achieving a low error on the training data and minimizing model complexity for better generalization. This parameter can be tuned to optimize performance, particularly to adjust how much the model penalizes misclassification.

The model has 743 support vectors, indicating the instances from the training data that define the decision boundary. Among these, 374 are for one class and 369 for the other, suggesting a fairly balanced influence from both classes on the model’s decision-making process.

There are two classes being predicted: 'Ürgüp Sivrisi' and 'Çerçevelik'. The representation of these classes in terms of support vectors shows that the model considers a substantial amount of information from both categories, which is crucial for maintaining accuracy across diverse seed types.

True Positives (TP) for 'Ürgüp Sivrisi': 1021 instances were correctly classified as 'Ürgüp Sivrisi'. False Negatives (FN) for 'Ürgüp Sivrisi': 92 instances were incorrectly classified as 'Çerçevelik'. True Positives (TP) for 'Çerçevelik': 1208 instances were correctly classified as 'Çerçevelik'. False Positives (FP) for 'Ürgüp Sivrisi': 179 instances were incorrectly classified as 'Ürgüp Sivrisi'.

The confusion matrix allows us to calculate key performance metrics such as precision, recall, and the overall accuracy of the model.
	
Precision for 'Ürgüp Sivrisi' can be calculated as TP / (TP + FP) = 1021 / (1021 + 179) which comes out to be 85.08%. Recall for 'Ürgüp Sivrisi' is TP / (TP + FN) = 1021 / (1021 + 92) which is about 91.73%.

The classification rate here is **0.8916**, indicating that approximately **89.16%** of the total predictions made by the model were correct. This rate is a direct measure of the model's accuracy, reflecting how effectively the model can classify the pumpkin seed types into 'Ürgüp Sivrisi' and 'Çerçevelik'. A classification rate of over 89% is generally considered good, showing that the SVM model has performed well in distinguishing between the two classes based on the given features.

However, while this rate shows high accuracy, there is still room for improvement, especially considering the potential impact of false positives and false negatives on the practical application of such a model in a real-world setting. Fine-tuning the model's parameters or incorporating additional or more discriminative features could potentially increase this accuracy further.

I developed to fine-tune the gamma parameter in an SVM model and evaluate its performance across different kernels. This function is based on insights from Baranyai, L. (2021) who provided guidance on SVM kernel and gamma selection in R.

The function's aim is to adjust the gamma parameter, which defines how much influence a single training example has. The goal is to find the optimal gamma that improves model accuracy for different kernel types.

It tests four types of kernels: 'linear', 'polynomial', 'radial', and 'sigmoid'. Each kernel represents a different way of handling the data in the feature space, from linear separations to more complex, non-linear boundaries.

The function starts with a default gamma (gdv = 1/12) and tests the classification performance of the model at this gamma, a gamma scaled down by 50% (scale = 0.5), and a gamma scaled up by the same factor.

The results underscore the crucial role of selecting the appropriate kernel and gamma settings in SVM models. Although the radial kernel performs well at the default gamma, it achieves the highest classification rate when the gamma is slightly increased. This indicates that fine-tuning the gamma value can enhance the model's ability to capture complex patterns in the data. Conversely, the performance of other kernels like polynomial and sigmoid can vary significantly with different gamma settings, showing that adjustments in gamma can lead to improvements or deteriorations in model accuracy. Optimal settings are thus highly dependent on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the kernel used, demonstrating the importance of careful parameter optimization in SVM models.

**Conclusion**

Through exploratory data analysis, we gained valuable insights into the distribution and relationships among various seed attributes, enabling us to understand the underlying patterns and potential predictive factors. The use of SVM allowed us to model these relationships effectively, achieving a high classification accuracy of over 89%, demonstrating the model's robustness in distinguishing between the 'Çerçevelik' and 'Ürgüp Sivrisi' seed classes.

The model tuning phase was crucial, revealing the sensitivity of SVM performance to kernel choice and gamma settings. Adjustments in gamma particularly showed significant impacts on the accuracy of different kernels, highlighting the need for precise parameter optimization based on the dataset's characteristics.

**Future Consideration**

Looking ahead, there are several avenues for further research and improvement. Enhancing the model by exploring additional or more discriminative features could potentially increase its accuracy. Moreover, experimenting with different machine learning algorithms might offer new insights or better performance. Lastly, implementing cross-validation methods would provide a more robust evaluation of the model's predictive power and generalizability.

This study not only underscores the effectiveness of SVM in classifying complex datasets but also illustrates the importance of careful model tuning and feature selection in achieving optimal results. Future work will continue to refine these approaches, further enhancing the decision-making processes in agricultural practices and beyond.
